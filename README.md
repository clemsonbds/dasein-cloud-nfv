# dasein-cloud-nfv

##Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a proof of concept that [Dasein](http://www.dasein.org/) can be used to standardize the Nf-Vi Interface (interface the VIM uses to manage the NFVI) according to the [ETSI specifications](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-MAN/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_nfv-man001v010101p.pdf).We use Dasein to abstract the infrastructure APIs and features into one consumable by NFV managers.
