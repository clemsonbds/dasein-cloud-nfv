# dasein-cloud-nfv
VIM-facing frontend for Dasein Cloud, implementing Nf-Vi interface according to ETSI specs.

#Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a proof of concept that Dasein can be used to standardize the Nf-Vi Interface (interface the VIM uses to manage the NFVI) according to the ETSI specifications.We use Dasein to abstract the infrastructure APIs and features into one consumable by NFV managers.
